DETERMINING POTENTIAL THREATS TO ACROPORA PALMATA REPRODUCTION AT SALT RIVER BAY NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK AND ECOLOGICAL PRESERVE
# Project Goals
1) Quantify the presence of pollutants in Salt River Bay

2) Investigate the correlation of pollutants with Acropora palmata reproduction to assess their potential impact on coral health using
both a field and laboratory-based approach

3) Make inferences about potential sources of the pollutants from the surrounding watershed

Note: Goal 2 will not be accomplished during this project analysis

# Brief Methodology and Importance of Data
Coral skeleton and sediment samples were analyzed on a Thermo Element XR, a high-resolution sector field inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), which was used to perform a multi-elemental analysis.

This ICP-MS analysis provided concentrations of potentially toxic metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni, Co, Zn, Sn, etc. and Hg was analyzed separately)

The analysis also provided concentrations of elements used for water quality parameters that may indicate salinity and turbidity changes
(Ba, Sr, Mg, Al, Fe, Mn), which can present challenges for coral reef sustainability 

Examining these elements in the sediment assists in source location and examining the elements in the coral skeleton assists in 
determining exposure.

# Statistical Analysis
PCA and RDA were run on both the sediment and coral skeleton data sets. 

The results from those analyses further directed the hypothesis tesing which include ANOVA tests of individual elements. 

# Instructions for Running Code and Examining Data
The code is in a single markdown file under the scripts folder. 

The data folder contains all csv files used for the analysis. 

The figures folder currently does not contain any figures, but my final figures will go there. 

# Full Abstract (If interested)
Populations of Acropora palmata (Elkhorn coral) were previously one of the most abundant reef building corals in the Caribbean, but they have declined more than 80% in the last 30 years. In addition to rising sea surface temperatures, ocean acidification, white band disease outbreaks and storms, coral face local anthropogenic pollution resulting in degraded water quality. The surviving A. palmata in Salt River Bay National Historic Park and Ecological Preserve (SARI) in St. Croix, USVI have shown reproductive impairment demonstrating almost no gonadal material from tissue biospsies, but coral that have been sampled at Buck Island Reef National Monument (BUIS), northeast of the St. Croix mainland, have a greater reproductive output at most sites. Poor reproductive capability could be attributed to pollution in the vicinity of SARI resulting in poor water quality. The purpose of this study is to: 1) quantify the presence of pollutants in Salt River Bay, 2) investigate the correlation of pollutants with Acropora palmata reproduction to assess their potential impact on coral health using both a field and laboratory-based approach, and 3) make inferences about potential sources of the pollutants from the surrounding watershed. To fulfill these objectives, an elemental analysis will be performed on two types of field samples from SARI and BUIS: coral skeletons and sediment. The elemental analysis will assist in determining sources and exposure, and if there is a correlation between metals, turbidity or other differences in water quality and the reproductive failure in the SARI A. palmata population. This study will also incorporate a coral toxicity bioassay in the lab to determine metal toxicity on coral health by measuring coral wound healing and the photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic dinoflagellates. Additionally, a FoRAM index will be implemented to evaluate ecological damage from contaminants at each site (SARI and BUIS). The integration of the various methods in this study will provide a diagnostic assessment of which stressors may be responsible for the observed reduction in A. palmata fecundity at St. Croix. This information will assist in implementing future management strategies regarding A. palmataâ€™s preservation and recovery.

# Project Title
DETERMINING POTENTIAL THREATS TO ACROPORA PALMATA REPRODUCTION AT SALT RIVER BAY NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK AND ECOLOGICAL PRESERVE
# Project Goals
1) Quantify the presence of pollutants in Salt River Bay

2) Investigate the correlation of pollutants with Acropora palmata reproduction to assess their potential impact on coral health using
both a field and laboratory-based approach

3) Make inferences about potential sources of the pollutants from the surrounding watershed

Note: Goal 2 will not be accomplished during this project analysis

# Brief Methodology and Importance of Data
Coral skeleton and sediment samples were analyzed on a Thermo Element XR, a high-resolution sector field inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), which was used to perform a multi-elemental analysis.

This ICP-MS analysis provided concentrations of potentially toxic metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni, Co, Zn, Sn, etc. and Hg was analyzed separately)

The analysis also provided concentrations of elements used for water quality parameters that may indicate salinity and turbidity changes
(Ba, Sr, Mg, Al, Fe, Mn), which can present challenges for coral reef sustainability 

Examining these elements in the sediment assists in source location and examining the elements in the coral skeleton assists in 
determining exposure.
